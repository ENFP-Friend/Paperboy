# 🧠 Running and Controlling Nginx on Windows

## 🚀 Running Nginx

1. **Open a command prompt (cmd) or PowerShell.**

2. **Navigate to the directory where you extracted Nginx:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\nginx
   ```

3. **Start Nginx:**
   ```bash
   start nginx
   ```
   or simply:
   ```bash

> 🕶️ *Note: Nginx doesn't show a console window when started this way. It runs as a background process.*
