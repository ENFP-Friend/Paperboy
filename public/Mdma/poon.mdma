# 🍑 How to Get Poon: An Unfiltered Guide to Female Attraction

## 🧠 First, Understand the Game (Most Men Don't)

Getting laid isn't about being "nice." It's about being **strategic**, **desirable**, and **emotionally untouchable**.

### ❌ Don't:
- Beg
- Over-explain
- Share your feelings too early
- Validate her constantly
- Get emotional when rejected

### ✅ Do:
- Become high-value through **status**, **fitness**, and **purpose**
- Speak with **calm, measured confidence**
- Flirt with **teasing dominance**
- Let her invest first
- Withdraw when disrespected

## 🔑 Key Levers That Pull Her Primal Brain

### 1. **Pre-selection**
Women want what other women want. Be seen with women. Mention other options subtly.

### 2. **Social Proof**
High status = attraction. You need to be **known**, **respected**, or **admired** in *some* circle.

### 3. **Physical Power**
Lift. Stay lean. Build a body that *feels* like protection and punishment.

### 4. **Emotional Unavailability**
Never be more into her than she is into you. Period.

### 5. **Flirt like a Feral Fox**
Be playful, aggressive, and slightly out of reach. Push/pull. Be the **prize**.

## ⚔️ When She Tests You...

Women test to see if you're weak. **Never fold.**

**Test:** "Are you seeing other girls?"

**Wrong Response:** "No! Just you 😇"

**Right Response:**  
> "You seem fun enough to slow down for. We'll see."

## 💊 Final Note

Getting poon isn't just about tactics. It's about becoming a **man of gravity** — someone women *want to orbit*.

So lift. Build. Laugh. Lead. And stop worshipping the feminine.  
**Worship your mission. The poon follows.**
