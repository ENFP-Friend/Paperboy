# 📬 Paperboy
![Paperboy Logo](public/img/logo.png)

**Paperboy** is a modular, map-based flyer delivery route visualizer.  
It starts as a browser-based MVP that solves naive delivery routes using geometric distance, and is structured for my **own future extension** — including path-aware routing, kerb-snapping, and backend support via OSRM.

---

## ✅ MVP Features

- Render flyer drop points on an ESRI satellite map
- Solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using in-browser greedy or 2-opt heuristics
- Display the ordered route visually
- Load map layers: roads, walkable paths, and toggleable building outlines
- Runs fully client-side (no backend needed for MVP)

---

## 🔁 Upgrade Path

The structure is designed for **my own future development**, including:

- Switching from Euclidean distance to real walking paths using OSRM
- Server-side TSP solving via Flask (OR-Tools or custom heuristics)
- Snapping to kerb lines and paths using cleaned OSM/GeoJSON
- Integrating multi-zone clustering or batching for high-volume delivery
